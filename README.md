# Smart Home

Collecting sensor data such as temperature values is an example of smart home use cases. To display sensor data in real time, the use of AWS AppSync / GraphQL with its real-time message transmission capabilities is a good choice.

An Angular-based web application is used as the frontend. For the integration of the backend with the frontend, the frontend library of AWS Amplify is integrated into the Angular application to easily implement authentication and GraphQL API calls.
